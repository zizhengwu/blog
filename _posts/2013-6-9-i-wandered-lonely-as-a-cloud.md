title: "Tranquility: An Empathetic Approach to 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'"
---

I really enjoy this poem, because I am touched by the so-called  "bliss of solitude". I appreciate the remarkable power of the imagination in Wordsworth's sense, assimilating so many varied things, bringing them together into an aesthetic unity and a meaningful whole. He wandered lonely as a cloud, but soon he found he was accompanied by the daffodils, breeze and waves. They can fill his heart with pleasure and dance with him. What an illusion fairyland artistic conception! We can sense that the author break away from the real world and float into an abstract space, where only exists the cosmic nature of life being, where obsession of real life is humble to the dust. 

It reminds me of the novel "The Garden of Forking Paths" written by Jorge Luis Borges. I appreciate the following paragraph:

>Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdomsâ€¦ I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars. Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny -- that of the hunted. For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. 

I guess Wordsworth and Borges share the same idea, they probe into the infinity and would like to wander as a cloud to get absorbed into the universe and cut themselves off from the world to be an abstract spectator. 

When reading such beautiful pieces, I can sense my mind in tranquility, which, I believe, makes me closer to the essence of life.
