title: Hell Is Other People—A Short Review of "The Social Network"
---

Given the title "Social Network", I thought it would involve how the Social Network Site affects our daily lives and its far-reaching impact on our enormous world. Yet it simply deals with Mark Zuckerberg. With the flow of Mark’s memories, I recognized the eternally classic elements——friendship, loyalty, envy and betrayal. It’s likely that this is the key factor why the early phase of Facebook has been adapted to novel and film.

The disputes between Mark and the people around him are always the center of the film. It's undeniable that it is the identity of the creator of Facebook that makes Mark’s story appealing or somehow ironical. Mark remodeled the social network to the root but his own relationships are a real mess.

To the end of the film, the only conclusion we could draw is that Mark Zuckerberg is unpredictable with unknown motivation hidden behind his swift brief but fierce language. Despite that he emphasized his innocence repeatedly, he was sued by his co-cooperator and even his best friend. Every character seems to have been involved in the irresistible vortex, which makes it tough to judge the whole issue.

One thing is for sure, the coming out of the Facebook is disrupting masses of things and meanwhile raised a series of questions——When we can easily have hundreds of thousands of "friends", what the hell does the friend mean? When interpersonal communication becomes one-sided display and viewing, we are no longer lonely or even more?

I just don’t know.
