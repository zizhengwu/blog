title: "Life: An Ambiguous Approach to 'Hills Like White Elephants'"
---

It is the gap between people that impresses me most in the novel "Hills Like White Elephants". For the girl, the baby is a bond gifted by god to anchor them down. While for the man, the baby is an inanimate burden which can be ridded of by "let the air in". Worse still, there is no effective way to narrow the gap. The conversation between them shows no harmony and even widens the gap. We can trust the fact that they love each other deeply and make every effort to convince the other, yet sign about the irreconcilable gap and the unknown ending.

This novel also makes me reflect on the man's free will of making choice. It reminds me of the novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being". I guess beneath the iceberg Hemingway created, he intended to probe into the opposition: the lightness/weight. The girl prefers the heaviest of burdens to crush them, pin them to the ground. While the man prefers to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being. What then shall they choose? Weight or lightness? It seems that Hemingway's answer is "Would you please please please please please please please stop talking," he has no intent to unveil the most mysterious and ambiguous opposition. But one thing is for sure, from the girl's "smile", we know something happened.

I believe Milan Kundera has insight into choice,  as he wrote in the "The Unbearable Lightness of Being":

>We can never know what to choose, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.
There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, sketch is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the ground work for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.

Compared with Milan Kundera, Hemingway set the novel in a vivid landscape: a railway station in the middle of the desert with no shade with two lines running together but separated. Perhaps thatâ€™s what life is like. For the universe, each person is only a dot on the earth passed by others.
