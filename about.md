Who has seen the wind?  
Neither you nor I:  
But when the trees bow down their heads  
The wind is passing by.

The wind is passing thro'.  
But when the leaves hang trembling  
Neither I nor you:  
Who has seen the wind?

谁见到过风？  
你没有，我也没有：  
但当树儿低下头  
便是风儿经过时。

便是风儿正穿过。  
但当叶儿在颤抖  
你没有，我也没有：  
谁见到过风？
